def print_fibonacci_series(num_elements):
    '''
    Purpose:
    ---
    Prints the first num_elements of the Fibonnaci series.
    The next element of the series is given by:
        next_element = current_element + prev_element
    The code loops for num_elements and prints out the next element.
    
    Input Arguments:
    ---
    `num_elements` :  [ int ]
        number of elements in Fibonacci series to be printed
    
    Returns:
    ---
    None
    
    Example call:
